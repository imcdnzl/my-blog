Over the years I've had a number of blogs and published contents in different places - the most recent being at <http://blog.next-genit.co.uk/>. *So why create a new blog now?* Well hopefully this post will explain a bit more!

The main reason was because I started a new role, and I thought I'd better do a blog a bit more technical than just using something like Blogger or pre-packaged Wordpress. They are great, and would have been easier, but it's great for me to learn and play. Even though I've led large AWS and Azure projects, teams of software developers and done a few bits and pieces myself I'd lost a bit of the edge since my last lot of serious coding which was on the Linux kernel when I did my [PhD](https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/handle/10289/8320).

So I went off and had a look at blogging platforms and asked people on Twitter what they thought also. I have a natural bias to trying to do things higher in the stack where possible as that's inherently less work to keep running, and far easier to keep secure. As such I ended up looking at Hugo vs Jekyll.

Aspergers or high functioning autism.

Also on git you can see how I do things if you want - link to repo

Hugo vs Jekyll. Jekyll has docs but Hugo is newer. Nothing wrong with Ruby but lots being done with Go these days. Went and installed Go on WSL but forgot that it's all binaries so no need.

WSL uses same IP address as machine for testing Hugo server. Not mentioned in FAQs (link) so made a pull request - have to love working in the open.

Look at git submodules for themes and choose a theme

Tend to dive into things deeply - probably because I started on machine code, difference to assembler.

Will write a blog I hope on using Hugo
