You've got a great idea for your startup, a great team but how do you get started with Azure to build this solution? So you go to the Azure portal or have a look at the list of the services https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/ and there's a *lot* of services there. Azure can solve all the world's problems but you just want to get started so what to do?

First thing I'd say is to keep it as simple as possible. A good developer is a lazy developer. There's no need to reinvent things that have been solved by others, when you can focus on building out your good idea instead. Friends don't let friends build servers.

Serverless - why use it https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/solutions/serverless/

Azure Functions - SQL API

Cosmos DB

Can use SQL but why nosql? Cassandra, Gremlin, Mongo too
Global writes as well as global reads

Now I'm presuming that you're wanting to use a bit of AI in your application but you've heard how hard https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng
cognitive services

So now that you've got a high level understanding of the technology how do you learn in more detail? [Microsoft Learn](https://microsoft.com/learn) is a great place to start - it's a new training site that Microsoft has built that allows you to learn while actually using Azure without having to pay a penny. What's more you can get cool badges, and who doesn't want that?

Not only is training free but you can also sign for Azure Free at https://azure.com/free/.

Now go out and then build something great!

Once you've got the basics working, what next?

Monitor functions https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring
Azure advisor https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview
security center https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-intro

And even more:
graduate to managed databases, containers, azure data lake, app services (who wants to run web servers), check security center, advisor, azure devops
